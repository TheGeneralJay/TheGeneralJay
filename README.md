Welcome to my GitHub page! I am a beginner programmer with a desire to learn. I am currently taking courses with George Brown College in Toronto. I am not too certain on what I want to focus on, so I am dipping my toe into whatever languages interest me at the moment. I am still learning, and am always open to suggestions or help. It's much appreciated!
